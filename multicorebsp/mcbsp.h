 * (2) the tag and payload data is read and sent somewhere between

 * computation superstep begins. The performance gain is two-fold:
 * (a) bsp_hpsend avoids buffering-on-send, and
 * (b) BSP may send messages during a computation phase, thus
 *     overlapping computation with communication.
 *
 * Ad (a): normally, BSMP in BSP copies tag and payload data at
 * least three times. It buffers on bsp_send (buffer-on-send),
 * it buffers at the receiving processes' incoming BSMP queue 
 * (buffer-on-receive), and finally bsp_get_tag and bsp_move 
 * copy the data in the target user-supplied memory areas. To 
 * also eliminate the latter data movement, please consider
 * using bsp_hpmove.
 *
 * Ad (b): it is not guaranteed this overlap results in faster 
 * execution time. You should think about if using these high-
 * performance primitives makes sense on a per-application 
 * basis, and factor in the extra costs  of structuring your 
 * algorithm to enable correct use of these primitives.

 * See bsp_move for general remarks. This function
 * returns a pointer to an area in the incoming
 * message buffer where the requested message tag
 * and message payload reside.
 * The function returns the size (in bytes) of the
 * message payload.
 *
 * Take care *not* to free the memory referred to
 * by these pointers; the data resides in a 
 * MulticoreBSP-managed buffer area and will be
 * freed by the run-time system.
 *
 * Warning: use this high-performance function
 *          with care; out of bound access on tag
 *          or payload can cause corruption of
 *          other messages in queue.
 *
 * Note: if MCBSP_COMPATIBILITY_MODE is defined,
 *       the return type of this function is `int'.
 *       Otherwise, is it of type `size_t'.
 *
 * @param p_tag     Where to store the pointer to

 * @param p_payload Where to store the pointer to

 * @return Pointer to the area where the message
 * tag and payload reside, or -1 if the message
